                <p>*Qualifying purchase amount must be on one receipt, excluding the following: special orders, gift
                    cards, Guitar Center Rentals, Guitar Center Repairs, Guitar Center Lessons, used items, vintage
                    items, open-box items, clearance items and any purchase where a manual discount is taken at the
                    register. Cannot be combined with promotional coupons. No interest will be charged and equal monthly
                    payments are required on promo purchase until it is paid in full. The payments equal the initial
                    total promo purchase amount divided by the number of months in the promo period, rounded up to the
                    next whole dollar. These payments may be higher than the payments that would be required if this
                    purchase was a non-promo purchase. Any monthly payments shown in connection with this promotional
                    offer exclude taxes and delivery and should allow you to pay off the promotional purchase within the
                    promo period if (1) you make your payments by the due date each month and (2) this is the only
                    balance on your account during the promo period. If you have other balances on your account, this
                    monthly payment will be added to the minimum payment applicable to those balances. Regular account
                    terms apply to non-promo purchases. For new accounts: Purchase APR is 29.99%. Minimum interest
                    charge is $2. Existing cardholders: See your credit card agreement terms. Subject to credit
                    approval.</p>
